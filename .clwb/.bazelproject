# this file was hand-written to narrow down the scope of the project when using JetBrains IDEs.
# its definitions affect both which project dirs are visible as part of the project in the IDE,
# IDE indexing of the same, and mainly the scope of bazel syncing through the bazel plugin for JetBrains IDEs.
# it does not in any way affect the scope of a bazel build command other than those issued by the IDE through the bazel plugin.
#
# note: keeping this file only include targets which successfully build, keeps the bazel plugin's sync error free,
#       thus facilitating maintaining a healthy bazel plugin log which can be monitored for real issues with the selected targets.
